To install in an OpenACS system, follow the standard practices for
downloading, uncompressing, and installing a local copy of this package.

Detailed instructions follow.

Download Q-Forms

The easiest way is to go to https://github.com/tekbasse/q-forms
and click on the ZIP button on the left side.

# From shell, that would be something like:

wget https://github.com/tekbasse/q-forms/archive/master.zip

# if wget isn't available locally, try fetch or curl.

Uncompress Q-Forms

# Once downloaded, unzip the file with 'unzip'.
# That might have to be grabbed from freebsd ports.

unzip master.zip

# Then rename the directory:

mv q-forms-master q-forms

# move the directory to the openacs/packages/ directory

mv q-forms your-openacs-4/packages/.

# change to the openacs-4/packages directory

cd your-openacs-4/packages

# changes permissions to match other packages
# replace user_name and user_group with your local ones. Sometimes they're openacs:openacs, sometimes nobody:nogroup etc

chown -R user_name:user_group q-forms

# make sure the file permissions are consistent with the rest of openacs

chmod -R 754 q-forms

# Then start openacs if it isn't already.

# Browse to your website's local url:

/acs-admin/

# click "Install Software"

# click "Install from Local"

# click on the box next to Q-Forms

# click the "Install or update checked applications" button

# follow instructions (usually requiring server restart) 

# That's it!
