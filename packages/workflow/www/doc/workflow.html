<h3>A: WF #3: Redirect After Action</h3>

<p> After an action has been completed, depending on the action, we
will redirect you to one of: </p>

<ul>

  <li> Your task list </li>

  <li> The page for the case (e.g. the content item page in the right package and folder). </li>
  
  <li> The object list page (e.g. the folder page) </li>
  
  <li> The "create new object" page. </li>

</ul>

<p> This will be specified in the workflow spec as an "redirect_to" on
actions, with possible values of "task_list", "case", "case_list", or
"new_case". </p>

<p> This assumes we have already implemented #6 below. </p>

<p> It will require changes to the API, in order for
workflow::case::action::execute to be able to return a URL. </p>

<p> TODO: Look in more detail at what's needed. </p>

<p> Estimate: 6 hours. Risk: Med. Recommended. </p>




<h3>A: WF #10: Task list UI</h3>

<p> Write a generic task list UI that lets you find tasks which you
are supposed to do, and get to them. </p>

<p> It should use the list builder so you can sort, filter, and
paginate. </p>

<p> Requires #6. </p>

<p> Time estimate: 10 hours. Risk: Low. </p>
