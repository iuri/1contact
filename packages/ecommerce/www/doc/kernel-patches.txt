patches the acs-tcl and acs-subsites packages to fill in the http logged in user's email into the form when making the transition to https login

## replace line 112 (approximately) in packages/acs-tcl/tcl/security-procs.tcl in the procedure definition of sec_handler that should read as follows:

	ad_returnredirect "/register/index?return_url=[ns_urlencode [ad_conn url]?[ad_conn query]]"

with this:

  	ad_returnredirect "/register/index?return_url=[ns_urlencode [ad_conn url]&http_id=$user_id&[ad_conn query]]"

## you will also need to add http_id handling to packages/acs-subsite/www/register/index.tcl and index.adp

add the following to expected variables for index.tcl.ad_page_contract
    http_id:optional

then add the following to the body of the index.tcl script

    if {[info exists http_id]} {
        template::query select_email email onevalue "select email from parties where party_id = :http_id"
    } else {
        set http_id ""
    }     

on register/index.adp do the following:

change 

	<h2>Log In</h2>

to 
	<h2><if @http_id@ not nil>Secure </if>Log In</h2>

and after the first <hr> tag (roughly line 11) add 

	<if @http_id@ not nil><p>Please login to our secure server.</if>

## that's it, ofcourse you can customize the template as you wish.
