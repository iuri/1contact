ad_page_contract {

    this script will:
    (1) put this order into the 'confirmed' state
    (2) try to authorize the user's credit card info and either
    (a) redirect them to a thank you page, or
    (b) redirect them to a "please fix your credit card info" page
    If they reload, we don't have to worry about the credit card
    authorization code being executed twice because the order has
    already been moved to the 'confirmed' state, which means that
    they will be redirected out of this page.
    We will redirect them to the thank you page which displays the
    order with the most recent confirmation date.
    The only potential problem is that maybe the first time the
    order got to this page it was confirmed but then execution of
    the page stopped before authorization of the order could occur.
    This problem is solved by the scheduled procedure,
    ec_query_for_payment_zombies, which will try to authorize
    any 'confirmed' orders over half an hour old.
