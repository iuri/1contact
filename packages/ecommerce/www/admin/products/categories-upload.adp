<p>This page uploads a CSV file containing product category names and creates product category mappings.</p>

<p>The file format should made up of lines where the first column is a sku and all subsequent columns are names 
which match one of a subsubcategory, a subcategory or a category (matched in that order). Category
matching is case insensitive.</p>

<p>If a subcategory match is found, the product is placed into the matching subcategory as well as the parent category  
of the matching subcategory. If no match is found for a product, no mapping entry is made.</p>
