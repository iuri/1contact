<li><b>Set the Base Cost:</b>
<input type=text name=base_shipping_cost size=5 value="@base_shipping_cost@">
The Base Cost is the base amount that everybody has to pay regardless of
what they purchase.  Then additional amounts are added, as specified below.
</li>

<li><b>Set the Per-Item Cost:</b>
If the "Shipping Price" field of a product is filled in, that will 
override any of the settings below.  Also, you can fill in the
"Shipping Price - Additional" field if you want to charge the
customer a lower shipping amount if they order more than one of the
same product.  (If "Shipping Price - Additional" is blank, they'll
just be charged "Shipping Price" for each item).
<ul>
If the "Shipping Price" field is blank, charge them by one of
these methods <b>(fill in only one)</b>:
  <li>Default Amount Per Item:
  <input type=text name=default_shipping_per_item size=5 value="@default_shipping_per_item@"></li>
  <li>Weight Charge: <input type=text size=5 name=weight_shipping_cost value="@weight_shipping_cost@">
@currency@ / @weight_unit@
  </ul></li>

<li><b>Set the Express Shipping Charges:</b>
Ignore this section if you do not do express shipping.  The amounts you specify below will be <b>added to</b> the amounts you set above if the user elects to have their order express shipped.
  <ul>
  <li>Additional Base Cost: <input type=text name=add_exp_base_shipping_cost size=5 value="@add_exp_base_shipping_cost@"></li>
  <li>Additional Amount Per Item: <input type=text name=add_exp_amount_per_item size=5 value="@add_exp_amount_per_item@"></li>
</ul></li>

<li>Additional Amount by Weight: 
<input type=text name=add_exp_amount_by_weight size=5 value="@add_exp_amount_by_weight@">
@currency@ / @weight_unit@</li>
<li>
Shipping costs based on the value of an order (value-based shipping)
is supported, but not recommended. See procedure <a href="/api-doc/proc-view?proc=ecds%5fbase%5fshipping%5fprice%5ffrom%5forder%5fvalue">ecds_base_shipping_price_from_order_value</a>
for examples on how to implement this.
