    This adds an item to an 'in_basket' order, although if there
    exists a 'confirmed' order for this user_session_id, the user is
    told they have to wait because 'confirmed' orders can potentially
    become 'in_basket' orders (if authorization fails), and we can
    only have one 'in_basket' order for this user_session_id at a
    time.  Most orders are only in the 'confirmed' state for a few
    seconds, except for those whose credit card authorizations are
    inconclusive.  Furthermore, it is unlikely for a user to start
    adding things to their shopping cart right after they've made an
    order.  So this case is unlikely to occur often.  I will include a
    ns_log Notice so that any occurrences will be logged.
