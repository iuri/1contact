    If a credit card failure occurs, the following actions
    need to be taken:

    1. ec_orders.order_state becomes in_basket
       ec_orders.saved_p becomes t
    2. ec_creditcards.failed_p becomes t
    3. any gift certificates used should be reinstated
    4. confirmed_date is set to null (because we use existence of
       confirmed_date to see if order is confirmed yet)
    5. ec_financial_transactions.transaction_type becomes null

    Call this procedure from within a transaction
